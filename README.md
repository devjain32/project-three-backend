# Plant Pal

Plant Pal allows users to search for plants in our database and add them to their virtual garden. Ideally, they will add plants they are currently growing or would like to buy. After plants are "in the garden", users can add notes to their plant. The idea here is that users would add tips and reminders that pertain to the health of their real plant. So the virtual plants reflect the actual plants that the user has. 

We hope to add a feature in the near future where users are able to access other users' notes and tips about growing specific plants! 

Check out the deployed version [here](https://myplantpal.herokuapp.com).

## Features
* The weather is displayed to the local user using the [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/api). 

## How to Use

First register with your email address and then sign in. "Home" will allow you to search for or add a plant to your garden. "My Garden" will display your plants to you. From here, you can delete a plant from your garden or add a note(s) to specific plants.
